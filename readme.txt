== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there documentation for the plugin?

Yes. Detailed documentation is available in the Documentation tab under Testimonials

= Page load speeds are slow =

If your page load speed is slow it will likely be because you are using Gravatars and you are not using a cache plugin. It is recommended that you use a cache plugin for any site, whether or not you are using Gravatars for Endorse. I use WP Super Cache.

= My testimonial is not showing? =

Ensure it is published. Go to the Testimonials admin panel and review the submitted testimonial. Once you are happy with it, then publish it, just like you publish a post.

= I just published a testimonial and it is not showing? =

If you have a cache plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, the page you use to display your testimonials may be cached. Simply edit the page and update it or wait and the cached files will eventually be deleted and refreshed.

= Why can't users upload photos? =

Users are not allowed to upload photos because it is a security issue. Use of gravatars is highly recommended. Administrators have the ability to add images in the Edit Testimonials admin panel.
